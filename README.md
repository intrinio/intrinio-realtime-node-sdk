# Intrinio NodeJS SDK for Real-Time Stock Prices

[Intrinio](https://intrinio.com/) provides real-time stock prices via a two-way WebSocket connection. To get started, [subscribe to a real-time data feed](https://intrinio.com/marketplace/data/prices/realtime) and follow the instructions below.

*NOTE*: For use in web JavaScript, we recommend [https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-web-sdk](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-web-sdk)

## Requirements

- NodeJS 6.9.5

## Features

* Receive streaming, real-time price quotes (last trade, bid, ask)
* Subscribe to updates from individual securities
* Subscribe to updates for all securities (contact us for special access)

## Installation
```
npm install intrinio-realtime --save
```

## Example Usage
```javascript
var IntrinioRealtime = require('intrinio-realtime')

// Create an IntrinioRealtime instance
var ir = new IntrinioRealtime({
  api_key: "INTRINIO_API_KEY",
  provider: "iex"
})

// Listen for quotes
ir.onQuote(quote => {
  var { ticker, type, price, size, timestamp } = quote
  console.log("QUOTE: ", ticker, type, price, size, timestamp)
})

// Join channels
ir.join("AAPL", "MSFT", "GE")
```

## Providers

Currently, Intrinio offers realtime data from the following providers:

* IEX - [Homepage](https://iextrading.com/)
* QUODD - [Homepage](http://home.quodd.com/)
* Cryptoquote - [Homepage](https://www.cryptoquote.io/)

Each has distinct price channels and quote formats, but a very similar API.

Each data provider has a different format for their quote data.

### QUODD

NOTE: Messages from QUOOD reflect _changes_ in market data. Not all fields will be present in every message. Upon subscribing to a channel, you will receive one quote and one trade message containing all fields of the latest data available.

## Channels

### QUODD

To receive price quotes from QUODD, you need to instruct the client to "join" a channel. A channel can be
* A security ticker with data feed designation (`AAPL.NB`, `MSFT.NB`, `GE.NB`, etc)

### IEX

To receive price quotes from the Intrinio Real-Time API, you need to instruct the client to "join" a channel. A channel can be
* A security ticker (`AAPL`, `MSFT`, `GE`, etc)
* The security lobby (`$lobby`) where all price quotes for all securities are posted
* The security last price lobby (`$lobby_last_price`) where only last price quotes for all securities are posted

Special access is required for both lobby channels. [Contact us](mailto:sales@intrinio.com) for more information.

### Cryptoquote

To receive price quotes from Cryptoquote, you need to instruct the client to "join" a channel. A channel can be

* `crypto:market_level_1:{pair_code}` - the Level 1 Market channel where all Level 1 price updates for the provided currency pair in all exchanges are posted (i.e. `crypto:pair:market_level_1:btcusd`)
* `crypto:exchange_level_1:{exchange_code}:{pair_code}` - the Level 1 Market channel where all Level 1 price updates for the provided currency pair and exchange are posted
* `crypto:exchange_level_2:{exchange_code}:{pair_code}` - the Level 2 Market channel where all Level 2 book updates for the provided currency pair and exchange are posted
* `crypto:firehose` - the Firehose channel where all message types for all currency pairs are posted (special access required)

The Intrinio REST API provides a listing of pairs, exchanges, and their corresponding codes:

* [Crypto Currency Pairs](https://intrinio.com/documentation/download#crypto_currency_pairs)
* [Crypto Exchanges](https://intrinio.com/documentation/download#crypto_exchanges)

## API Keys
You will receive your Intrinio API Key after [creating an account](https://intrinio.com/signup). You will need a subscription to the [IEX Real-Time Stock Prices](https://intrinio.com/data/realtime-stock-prices) data feed as well.

## Documentation

### Methods

`constructor(options)` - Creates a new instance of the IntrinioRealtime client.
* **Parameter** `options`: An object with properties `api_key` and `provider`, corresponding to your Intrinio API Key and a provider code ("iex", "quodd", or "cryptoquote").
```javascript
var ir = new IntrinioRealtime({
  api_key: "INTRINIO_API_KEY",
  provider: "iex"
})
```

---------

`destroy()` - Closes the WebSocket, stops the self-healing and heartbeat intervals. You MUST call this to dispose of the client.

---------

`onError(callback)` - Invokes the given callback when a fatal error is encountered. If no callback has been registered and no `error` event listener has been registered, the error will be thrown.
* **Parameter** `callback` - The callback to invoke. The error will be passed as an argument to the callback.

---------

`onQuote(callback)` - Invokes the given callback when a quote has been received.
* **Parameter** `callback` - The callback to invoke. The quote will be passed as an argument to the callback.
```javascript
ir.onQuote(quote => {
  var { ticker, type, price, size, timestamp } = quote
  console.log("QUOTE: ", ticker, type, price, size, timestamp)
})
```

---------

`join(...channels)` - Joins the given channels. This can be called at any time. The client will automatically register joined channels and establish the proper subscriptions with the WebSocket connection.
* **Parameter** `channels` - An argument list or array of channels to join. See Channels section above for more details.
```javascript
ir.join("AAPL", "MSFT", "GE")
ir.join(["GOOG", "VG"])
ir.join("$lobby")
```

---------

`leave(...channels)` - Leaves the given channels.
* **Parameter** `channels` - An argument list or array of channels to leave.
```javascript
ir.leave("AAPL", "MSFT", "GE")
ir.leave(["GOOG", "VG"])
ir.leave("$lobby")
```

---------

`leaveAll()` - Leaves all joined channels.

---------

`listConnectedChannels()` - Returns the list of joined channels. Recently joined channels may not appear in this list immediately.

### Events

`connect` - Emitted when connected to the websocket successfully.

---------

`quote` - Emitted when a new quote has been received.

---------

`error` - Emitted when a fatal error is encountered. If no `onError` callback has been registered and no event listener has been registered, the error will be thrown.

### Using a Proxy

Use a custom `http.Agent` implementation like [https-proxy-agent](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent) or [socks-proxy-agent](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent) and specify it as the `agent` parameter:
 
```javascript
var url = require('url');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');
var proxy = 'http://yourproxyaddress';
var options = url.parse(proxy);
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

var ir = new IntrinioRealtime({
  api_key: "INTRINIO_API_KEY",
  provider: "iex",
  agent: agent
})
```
